## Why
Loading configurations has always been a tedious and error-prone procedure. A common way to do it
consists in writing code to deserialize each fields of the configuration. The more fields there are,
the more code must be written (and tested and maintained...) and this must be replicated for each project.

This kind of code is boilerplate because most of the times the code can be automatically generated by
the compiler based on what must be loaded. For instance, if you are going to load an `Int` for a field
named `foo`, then probably you want some code that gets the values associated with the key `foo` in
the configuration and assigns it to the proper field after converting it to `Int`.

The goal of this library is to create at compile-time the boilerplate necessary to load a configuration of a
certain type. In other words, you define **what** to load and PureConfig provides **how** to load it.


## Not yet another configuration library
PureConfig is not a configuration library in the sense that it doesn't search for files or parse them.
It can be seen as a better front-end for the existing libraries.
It uses [typesafe config][typesafe-config] library for loading raw configurations and then
uses the raw configurations to do its magic.


## Add PureConfig to your project

In the sbt configuration file:

use scala `2.10` or `2.11`:

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.8" // or "2.10.5"
```

Add the library. For scala `2.11`

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.github.melrief" %% "pureconfig" % "0.3.0"
)
```

For scala `2.10` you need also the scala macro paradise plugin:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.github.melrief" %% "pureconfig" % "0.3.0",
compilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.0.1" cross CrossVersion.full)
)
```



For a full example of `build.sbt` you can have a look at this [build.sbt](https://github.com/melrief/pureconfig/blob/master/example/build.sbt)
used for the example.


## Example

In the [example directory](https://github.com/melrief/pureconfig/tree/master/example/src/main/scala/pureconfig/example)
there is an example of usage of pureconfig. In the example, the idea is to load a configuration for a directory
watcher service. The configuration file
(a real one is available [here](https://github.com/melrief/pureconfig/blob/master/example/src/main/resources/application.conf))
for this program will look like

```
dirwatch.path="/path/to/observe"
dirwatch.filter="*"
dirwatch.email.host=host_of_email_service
dirwatch.email.port=port_of_email_service
dirwatch.email.message="Dirwatch new path found report"
dirwatch.email.recipients=["recipient1,recipient2"]
dirwatch.email.sender="sender"
```

To load it, we define some classes that have proper fields and names

```scala
import java.nio.file.Path

case class Config(dirwatch: DirWatchConfig)
case class DirWatchConfig(path: Path, filter: String, email: EmailConfig)
case class EmailConfig(host: String, port: Int, message: String, recipients: Set[String], sender: String)
```

The use of `Path` gives us a chance to use a custom converter

```scala
import pureconfig._

import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.util.Try

implicit val deriveStringConvertForPath = fromString[Path](Paths.get)
```

And then we load the configuration

```scala
val config = loadConfig[Config].get // loadConfig returns a Try
```

And that's it.

You can then use the configuration as you want:

```scala
println("dirwatch.path: " + config.dirwatch.path)
println("dirwatch.filter: " + config.dirwatch.filter)
println("dirwatch.email.host: " + config.dirwatch.email.host)
println("dirwatch.email.port: " + config.dirwatch.email.port)
println("dirwatch.email.message: " + config.dirwatch.email.message)
println("dirwatch.email.recipients: " + config.dirwatch.email.recipients)
println("dirwatch.email.sender: " + config.dirwatch.email.sender)
```

It's also possible to operate directly on `Config` and `ConfigValue` types
of [typesafe config][typesafe-config] with the implicit helpers provided in the
`pureconfig.syntax` package:

```scala
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import pureconfig.syntax._

val config = ConfigFactory.load().to[Config].get
println("The loaded configuration is: " + config.toString)
```

## Whence the config files?

By default, PureConfig's `loadConfig()` methods load all resources in the classpath named:

- `application.conf`,
- `application.json`,
- `application.properties`, and
- `reference.conf`.

The various `pureconfig.loadConfig()` methods defer to [typesafe config][typesafe-config]'s
[`ConfigFactory`](https://typesafehub.github.io/config/latest/api/com/typesafe/config/ConfigFactory.html) to
select where to load the config files from. Typesafe Config has [well-documented rules for configuration
loading](https://github.com/typesafehub/config#standard-behavior) which we'll not repeat. Please see Typesafe
Config's documentation for a full telling of the subtleties.  If you need greater control over how config
files are loaded, refer to `ConfigFactory`'s options.

Alternatively, PureConfig also provides `pureconfig.loadConfigFromFiles()` which builds a configuration from
an explicit list of files. Files earlier in the list have greater precedence than later ones. Each file can
include a partial configuration as long as the whole list produces a complete configuration. For an example,
see the test of `loadConfigFromFiles()` in
[`PureconfSuite.scala`](https://github.com/melrief/pureconfig/blob/master/src/test/scala/pureconfig/PureconfSuite.scala).

Because PureConfig uses Typesafe Config to load configuration, it supports reading files in [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation), JSON, and Java `.properties` formats. HOCON is a delightful superset of both JSON and `.properties` that is highly recommended. As an added bonus it supports [advanced features](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/README.md#features-of-hocon) like variable substitution and file sourcing.
